== Ansible Automation Platform

=== How to Log In

The default login user is `+admin+` and the password is generated
randomly at install time; you will need the password to login in to the
AAP interface. You do not have to log in to the interface - the pattern
will configure the AAP instance; the pattern retrieves the password
using the same technique as the `+ansible_get_credentials.sh+` script
described below. If you want to inspect the AAP instance, or change any
aspects of its configuration, there are two ways to login and look at
it. Both mechanisms are equivalent; you get the same password to the
same instance using either technique.

=== Via the OpenShift Console

In the OpenShift console, navigate to Workloads > Secrets and select the
"`ansible-automation-platform`" project if you want to limit the number
of Secrets you can see.

The Secret you are looking for is in the `+ansible-automation-platform+`
project and is named `+controller-admin-password+`. If you click on it,
you can see the Data.password field. It is shown revealed below to show
that it is the same as what is shown by the script method of retrieving
it below:

=== Via https://github.com/validatedpatterns/ansible-edge-gitops/blob/main/scripts/ansible_get_credentials.sh[ansible_get_credentials.sh]

With your KUBECONFIG set, you can run
`+./scripts/ansible-get-credentials.sh+` from your top-level pattern
directory. This will use your OpenShift cluster admin credentials to
retrieve the URL for your Ansible Automation Platform instance, as well
as the password for its `+admin+` user, which is auto-generated by the
AAP operator by default. The output of the command looks like this (your
password will be different):
