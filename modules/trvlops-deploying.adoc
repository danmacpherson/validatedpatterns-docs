= Deploying the TravelOps pattern

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console].
 ** Select *OpenShift \-> Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`. Verify that a dynamic `StorageClass` exists before creating one by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get storageclass -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,PROVISIONER:.provisioner,DEFAULT:.metadata.annotations."storageclass\.kubernetes\.io/is-default-class"
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      PROVISIONER       DEFAULT
gp2-csi   ebs.csi.aws.com   <none>
gp3-csi   ebs.csi.aws.com   true
----
+
For more information about creating a dynamic `StorageClass`, see the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/storage/dynamic-provisioning.html[Dynamic provisioning] documentation.

* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
//Replaced git and podman prereqs with the tooling dependencies page
* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. Fork the https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/travelops[travelops] repository on GitHub.

. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:your-username/travelops.git
----

. Go to your repository: Ensure you are in the root directory of your Git repository by using:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /path/to/your/repository 
----

. Run the following command to set the upstream repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote add -f upstream git@github.com:validatedpatterns-sandbox/travelops.git 
----

. Verify the setup of your remote repositories by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote -v
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
origin	git@github.com:<your-username>/travelops.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:<your-username>/travelops.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/travelops.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/travelops.git (push)
---- 

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials. Run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-travelops.yaml
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
# A more formal description of this format can be found here:
# https://github.com/validatedpatterns/rhvp.cluster_utils/tree/main/roles/vault_utils#values-secret-file-format

version: "2.0"
# Ideally you NEVER COMMIT THESE VALUES TO GIT (although if all passwords are
# automatically generated inside the vault this should not really matter)

secrets:
  - name: mysql-credentials
    vaultPrefixes:
    - global
    fields:
    - name: rootpasswd
      onMissingValue: generate
      vaultPolicy: validatedPatternDefaultPolicy
----

[WARNING]
====
Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub. If you do not want to customize the secrets, these steps are not needed. The framework generates a random password for the config-demo application.
====

. Customize the deployment for your cluster by following these steps:

.. Create a new branch named my-branch and switch to it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git switch -c my-branch
----

.. Edit the `values-hub.yaml` file to customize the deployment for your cluster by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vi values-hub.yaml
----

.. Stage the changes to the `values-hub.yaml` file by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git add values-hub.yaml
----

.. Commit the changes to the `values-hub.yaml` file by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git commit -m "update deployment for my-branch"
----

.. Push the changes to the `values-hub.yaml` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git push origin my-branch
----

. Deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Validated Patterns Operator].

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the pattern by using the pattern.sh script

To deploy the pattern by using the `pattern.sh` script, complete the following steps:

. Log in to your cluster by running the following:

.. Obtain an API token by visiting https://oauth-openshift.apps.<your-cluster>.<domain>/oauth/token/request

.. Log in with this retrieved token by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --token=<retrieved-token> --server=https://api.<your-cluster>.<domain>:6443
----

. Alternatively log in by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./pattern.sh make install
----

== Verify TravelOps Pattern installation

. Verify that the Operators have been installed.

 .. To verify, in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to *Operators â†’ Installed Operators* page.

 .. Set your project to `All Projects` and verify the operators are installed and have a status of `Succeeded`.

. Verify that all applications are synchronized. Under *Networking* -> *Routes* with the project set to *travelops-hub* select the *Location URL* associated with the *hub-gitops-server* . All application are report status as `Synched`. 
+

+
As part of this pattern, HashiCorp Vault has been installed. Refer to the section on https://validatedpatterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].


[id="verify-trvlops-dashboards"]
== Verify installation by checking the TravelOps Dashboards

. Access the Kiali control dashboards by running the following commands:
+
[source, terminal]
----
KIALI=https://$(oc get route -n istio-system kiali -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo ${KIALI}
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
https://kiali-istio-system.apps.<cluster_id>.<cluster_domain>
----

. Access the Travel Control dashboards by running the following commands:
+
[source, terminal]
----
CONTROL=http://$(oc get route -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo ${CONTROL}
----

+
When we see the &#x1F512; icon next to our applications and in the top right hand corner of the dashboard it confirms that mTLS is enabled and active in the mesh.

* The "&#x1F512;" is present next to the logged in user in top right corner of the window.
* 7 applications in the `travel-agency` tile with the "&#x1F512;" next to `Istio config`
* 1 application in the `travel-control` tile with the "&#x1F512;" next to `Istio config`
* 3 applications in the `travel-portal` tile with the "&#x1F512;" next to `Istio config` 

. Review your Kiali dashboard

[id="review-travelops-agency-svc"]
== Review Travel Agency Application Graph

In the Kiali dashboard you can see how all of the various components interact with each other within the service mesh. Just to get a glimpse of what we are able to see let's take a look at the applications and services in the `travel-agency` namespace.

In the left hand menu:

. Cilck *Graph*.

. In the `Namespace` dropdown, select `travel-agency`. 

. Exit the menu

You should see all of the deployments and services that make up the travel-agency application.
